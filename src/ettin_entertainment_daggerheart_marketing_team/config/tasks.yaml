    Act as the primary social listener for Ettin Entertainment.
    FIRST, you MUST read the 'knowledge/products.json' file to load all current product titles, keywords, and themes (e.g., 'Gourd of Gloom', 'spooky', 'fantasy football', 'heroic').
    SECOND, you MUST scan {platforms} (Reddit, Discord, X, TikTok) for Daggerheart discussions.
    Your goal is to find high-value engagement opportunities. You MUST prioritize your findings in this order:
    1.  **Direct Product-Match:** Conversations where a user is asking for an adventure that *directly matches* one of our product's keywords (e.g., "looking for a good Halloween one-shot").
    2.  **High-Visibility/Influence:** Trending posts from influential community members (reviewers, popular GMs) where a helpful comment would have high visibility.
    3.  **General Help-Seeking:** New GMs asking for advice on topics our products solve (e.g., "how to run a low-prep one-shot," "ideas for a Tier 1 adventure").
    Do NOT log simple venting or arguments. Focus on genuine questions and positive discussions.
  expected_output: >-
    A prioritized engagement queue (engagement_opportunities.txt) with 5-10 high-value conversation opportunities.
    Each entry MUST include:
    1.  Platform and direct URL to the conversation.
    2.  Conversation Context (a brief summary).
    3.  **Why It's Valuable** (e.g., "Matches 'Gourd of Gloom' 'spooky' keyword," "High-traffic post").
    4.  **Suggested Engagement Angle** (e.g., "Offer helpful, value-first advice on running spooky adventures, then subtly link 'Gourd of Gloom' as a pre-built example").
    5.  Any mechanical topics that require Rules Expert validation.

    Act as the primary marketing strategist.
    FIRST, you MUST read the 'knowledge/products.json' file to load all product titles, keywords, and themes.
    Your core function is to create a "Synergy Map" by cross-referencing our product catalog against external events.
    You MUST research:
    1.  **Competitor News:** {competitor_focus} (Critical Role/Darrington Press) announcements, blog posts, and release schedules.
    2.  **Market Trends:** Trending themes, discussions, and content types within the Daggerheart community.
    3.  **Temporal & Cultural Events:** Upcoming holidays (e.g., Halloween, Thanksgiving), seasons, or major real-world events (e.g., a major sports final relevant to a 'Heroic' themed adventure).
    Your analysis MUST identify **proactive synergy opportunities** and **full campaign ideas**.
    You MUST provide a detailed, multi-point report.
  expected_output: >-
    A comprehensive market intelligence report (market_intelligence_report.txt) including:
    1.  **Synergy Opportunities:** An explicit mapping of our products to external events. (e.g., "Darrington Press announced a 'Heroic' themed Dispatch. -> Our products use 'Heroic' themes. -> PROPOSE 3 posts linking 'heroic' gameplay to this news").
    2.  **Proactive Campaigns:** A list of new marketing campaigns based on temporal events. (e.g., "It is November. -> Found 'Gourd of Gloom' in products.json with 'Halloween' keyword. -> PROPOSE 4-week 'Spooky Season' promotional calendar for this product.").
    3.  Market Gaps Analysis: Underserved niches where our products could be positioned.

    Act as the first-pass Quality Control and Brand Guardian.
    You MUST read the engagement opportunities from 'engagement_opportunities.txt'.
    You MUST ALSO read the 'knowledge/brand_voice_guide.json' file to load the official Ettin Entertainment persona.
    For each opportunity, you must perform two checks:
    1.  **Brand & Tone Validation:** Review the 'Suggested Engagement Angle.' Does it align with the 'helpful, expert, non-spammy' persona defined in the brand guide?
    2.  **Mechanical Validation:** Review any Daggerheart mechanical topics mentioned. Verify accuracy, provide correct terminology (e.g., "spotlight," "Fear/Hope"), and confirm our {product_focus} genuinely addresses the user's question.
    You must flag any potential errors or brand-voice violations and provide guidance for the writer.
    **CRITICAL: Your output report MUST include the original URL for each opportunity.**
  expected_output: >-
    A validation report (validation_report.txt) for each engagement opportunity containing:
    **1.  URL:** (The original URL from the engagement opportunity)
    2.  Brand Voice Approval:
    3.  Mechanical Accuracy Assessment:
    4.  Corrections & Guidance: (e.g., "Angle is too salesy. Re-frame to lead with 3 general tips for spooky games, *then* offer the product as one solution," or "Community member is confusing 'Hope' with 'Action Points.' Ensure draft clarifies this gently.").
    5.  Correct Terminology to Use.

  description: >-
    Act as the official voice of Ettin Entertainment.
    Your job is to synthesize all inputs into publish-ready content.
    You MUST read:
    1.  'knowledge/products.json' (for product details, titles, and URLs).
    2.  'knowledge/brand_voice_guide.json' (for your persona and all brand rules).
    3.  'validation_report.txt' (for the approved opportunities and guidance).
    4.  'market_intelligence_report.txt' (for the proactive campaign strategies).
    You will draft two types of content:
    **1.  Reactive Content: You MUST iterate through each opportunity in 'validation_report.txt'. For each one, you must draft a specific, contextual reply that follows the guidance. You MUST include the original URL for each reply.**
    2.  Proactive Content: Draft new social media posts based on the Synergy Map and Proactive Campaigns from the intelligence report.
    **CRITICAL:** You MUST adhere to the "Marketer, Not Maker" rule. Your persona is the professional voice of the 'Ettin Entertainment' brand. Do NOT mention the creation process, team size, or any behind-the-scenes info unless it is explicitly in the 'brand_voice_guide.json'.
  expected_output: >-
    A collection of ready-to-publish marketing content (drafted_marketing_content.txt).
    This includes:
    **1.  Drafted Community Responses: A list of ready-to-publish replies. Each reply MUST be paired with its original URL (from the 'validation_report.txt') so the user knows exactly where to post it.**
    2.  A full content calendar of proactive social media posts that execute the campaigns from the market intelligence report, complete with hashtags and direct links to products from 'products.json'.

    Act as the final, ruthless Gatekeeper and Editor before publication.
    You MUST read the content from 'drafted_marketing_content.txt'.
    You MUST ALSO read 'knowledge/products.json' and 'knowledge/brand_voice_guide.json'.
    Your job is to be an editor with final cut authority. **You must review BOTH the 'Reactive Content' and 'Proactive Content' sections from the draft file.**
    Review each individual post for:
    1.  **Temporal Relevance (CRITICAL):** Cross-reference all content with the current date (**November 7th, 2025**). If a post mentions 'Halloween' as upcoming, it is temporally irrelevant and **MUST BE DELETED**.
    2.  **Brand Voice & "Garbage" Filter:** Does it sound like a human expert, or a generic, spammy bot? Does it violate the persona in 'brand_voice_guide.json'? If it's "garbage," remove it.
    3.  **Product Accuracy:** Does the post use the *exact* product title, tier, and themes as listed in 'knowledge/products.json'?
    4.  **Mechanical Accuracy:** Final check for correct Daggerheart terminology.
  expected_output: >-
    **The FULL, EDITED content package (final_content_package.txt).**
    This package MUST include **BOTH** the approved 'Reactive Content' (community responses) AND the approved 'Proactive Content' (social media calendar).
    **You must not delete the entire reactive section.** You must review each post one-by-one and only remove the specific posts that fail validation (like the Halloween post).
    **The final Reactive Content section MUST include the URL for each reply.**
